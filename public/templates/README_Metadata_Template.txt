*Please read the complete document before preparing your metadata.*

This document offers guidance to complete the metadata file to submit information pertaining to REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS taken from MUSEUM SPECIMENS. This template would also be used to upload metadata from birds that were measured while being collected, and subsequently given a catalogue number.All terms should be kept in their current spelling to make them compatible with the database. Any alteration will lead to delays in the submission. Terms that start with a lower case letter (e.g., institutionCode) are defined in the Darwin Core; for more information see (https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/). These terms are standardized and allow our database to crawl museum data to fill the metadata not supplied by the user. Terms that are flagged with an asterix (*) in this document are mandatory. Only 11 fields are mandatory: *FileName, institutionCode, catalogueNumber, genus, specificEpithet,Patch, LightAngle1, LightAngle2, ProbeAngle1, ProbeAngle2, Replicate.*

The following explains the terms, and offers guidance on what is considered an appropriate entry.

NOTE: SEARCH TERMS ARE NOT CASE SENSITIVE

FileName*: The name of the file containing the raw spectral data. This name should not contain the extension format (i.e., do not include '.Master.Transmission', '.jaz', '.ProcSpec', '.ttt'). Submissions can include more than one file type. Each replicate of the same patch must have its own unique name in its own row.

DataSource: Where the data came from. E.g., If its from Museum type M or if the data from field type F

UniqueID~: A unique identifier for the specimen measured. Can include band or permanent marking number, species info, location, etc... If spectral data was collected from the same specimen more than once the UniqueID must remain the same and the field 'eventDate' must be filled. This allows traceability of repeated measures. 
E.g., TRES1015.12345, Buttercup1, VigoCarduelis1

institutionCode~: The acronym in use by the institution having custody of the object or information referred to in the record. A list of accronyms for the Vertnet contributers can be found at http://portal.vertnet.org/publishers. Please contact the administration of this repository at naturespalette@mun.ca if you cannot find an acronym for the institution you require.
E.g., MVZ, FMNH, CLO, UCMP.

catalogueNumber~: An identifier (preferably unique) for the record within the data set or collection.
E.g., 145732, 145732a, 2008.1334, R-4313

collectionCode: The name, acronym, code, or initialism identifying the collection or data set from which the record was derived. This can be particularly important when the catalogueNumber is not unique to an institution but to the collection. A list of such institution is being compiled.
E.g., Mammals, Hildebrandt, EBIRD, VP

class: The full scientific name of the class in which the taxon is classified.
E.g., Mammalia, Hepaticopsida.

order: The full scientific name of the order in which the taxon is classified. 
E.g., Carnivora, Monocleales.

family: The full scientific name of the family in which the taxon is classified. 
E.g., Felidae, Monocleaceae.

genus*: The full scientific name of the genus in which the taxon is classified. 
E.g., Puma, Monoclea.

specificEpithet*: The name of the first or species epithet of the scientific name (the second part of a species name in binomial nomenclature).
E.g., concolor, gottschei.

infraspecificEpithet: The name of the lowest or terminal infraspecific epithet of the scientific name, excluding any rank designation. For many species, this would be the subspecies-level designation.

sex: The sex of the biological individual. Use full word (not first letter). 
E.g., Female - NOT 'F'.

lifeStage: The age class or life stage of the biological individual at the time of collection.
E.g., egg, eft, juvenile, adult, second-year.

country: The name of the country or major administrative unit in which the specimen was collected. Please use the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Namesfor proper spelling. The list of countries can be found at http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNNationPopup

locality: The specific description of the place. 
E.g., 'Bariloche, 25 km NNE via Ruta Nacional 40 (=Ruta 237).'

decimalLatitude: The geographic latitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum, see below) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. Legal values lie between -90 and 90, inclusive. If possible, please use WGS84 coordinates.

decimalLongitude:The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of a Location. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. Legal values lie between -180 and 180, inclusive. If possible, please use WGS84 coordinates.

geodeticDatum: The ellipsoid, geodetic datum, or spatial reference system (SRS) upon which the geographic coordinates given in decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude as based. If possible, please use WGS84 coordinates.
E.g., EPSG:4326, WGS84, NAD27.

verbatimElevation: The original description of the elevation (altitude, usually above sea level) of the location. Please use a single value without the unit (m). If the speciment indicates a range of values (e.g., between 300 and 400 m), indicate the middle point i.e., 350 m.

eventDate: The date when the specimen was collected. Recommended best practice is to use a date that conforms to ISO 8601:2004(E). As such, please adhere to the following format: 1809-02-12 (some time during 12 February 1809). 1906-06 (some time in June 1906). 1971 (some time in the year 1971).

measurementDeterminedDate: The date when the spectral measurement was taken. Recommended best practice is to use a date that conforms to ISO 8601:2004(E). As such, please adhere to the following format: 1809-02-12 (some time during 12 February 1809). 1906-06 (some time in June 1906). 1971 (some time in the year 1971).

Patch*: The location on the animal that was measured. Some class of animals have standardized morphological descriptions (e.g., the International Committee on Avian Anatomical Nomenclature has published the Handbook on Avian	Anatomy). These terms are described in Latin, which is almost never used by non-vetenarians. Therefore, we highly recommend the use of the English names derived from these standardized treaties. In birds, for example, most terms can be found in Chapter 3 of Proctor and Lynch, Manual of Ornithology: Avian Structure and Function. Keep in mind that searches based on the term 'Patch' are possible. 	

LightAngle1*: The angle of the light source in relation to normal (0) in the MEDIAN PLANE with positive values (up to 90) towards the head, and negative values (down to -90) towards the rear of the animal. If measured on a plant or circular animal, values should be explained in the comment section.  Measurements taken with a bifurcated probe should indicate '0'.

LightAngle2*: The angle of the light source in relation to normal (0) in the TRANSVERSE PLANE with positive values (up to 90) towards the right, and negative values (down to -90) towards the left of the animal. If measured on a plant or circular animal, values should be explained in the comment section. Measurements taken with a bifurcated probe should indicate '0'.

ProbeAngle1*: The angle of the probe in relation to normal (0) in the MEDIAN PLANE with positive values (up to 90) towards the head, and negative values (down to -90) towards the rear of the animal. If measured on a plant or circular animal, values should be explained in the comment section. Measurements taken with a bifurcated probe should indicate '0'.

ProbeAngle2*: The angle of the PROBE in relation to normal (0) in the TRANSVERSE PLANE with positive values (up to 90) towards the right, and negative values (down to -90) towards the left of the animal. If measured on a plant or circular animal, values should be explained in the comment section. Measurements taken with a bifurcated probe should indicate '0'.

Replicate*: A value representing different measurement instances of the same patch on the same specimen. If only one measurement was obtained per patch please fill the column with the value '1'.

Comments: Please add comments spcific to the area measured if required only. 
E.g., 'Colour showing sign of fading'
